WEBVTT

00:06.756 --> 00:11.594
Shin, where are you?

00:20.228 --> 00:22.897
I hate crowded places.

00:23.606 --> 00:26.025
Let's get this over with and leave.

00:27.652 --> 00:28.903
You fool.

00:28.987 --> 00:31.156
Don't try to slack off.

00:33.366 --> 00:35.160
We do things the hard-boiled way.

00:36.369 --> 00:39.080
Don't tell me what to do.

00:39.164 --> 00:40.165
You're just Boiled.

00:40.957 --> 00:42.417
That's harassment, you know.

00:42.500 --> 00:43.418
Hey!

00:43.501 --> 00:45.086
What is it?

00:45.170 --> 00:47.464
Careful where you're stepping, Obiguro.

00:47.547 --> 00:48.381
What?

00:49.007 --> 00:50.467
It's an ant trail.

00:51.009 --> 00:54.137
Don't take lives other than the targets'.

00:54.220 --> 00:55.638
That's my motto.

00:56.473 --> 00:58.141
Don't act all high and mighty.

00:58.224 --> 00:59.059
<i>He's so hot!</i>

00:59.142 --> 01:00.894
- Hey!
- What?!

01:00.977 --> 01:02.979
Tell me if your feet hurt, okay?

01:03.063 --> 01:04.147
<i>He's so sweet!</i>

02:37.824 --> 02:38.658
Come on.

02:38.741 --> 02:40.743
Hurry, just do it!

02:40.827 --> 02:42.537
- Stop moving.
- Hurry up!

02:42.620 --> 02:43.496
HARD-BOILED

02:44.455 --> 02:46.875
Don't be such a wimp.
They're just eye drops.

02:46.958 --> 02:49.294
Come on, show me the other eye.

02:49.377 --> 02:52.755
You're lucky he had the antidote with him.

02:52.839 --> 02:55.425
Just standard practice as a poisoner.

02:57.010 --> 02:58.469
Who hired you?

02:58.553 --> 02:59.804
ON BREAK

02:59.888 --> 03:02.390
Will you let me off the hook if I tell?

03:02.473 --> 03:03.308
Yes?

03:04.100 --> 03:06.769
This is your poisoned knife, right?

03:06.853 --> 03:07.770
What?

03:07.854 --> 03:09.772
- Hey, what are you--
- Ouch!

03:10.440 --> 03:13.526
I'm gonna spill one drop every second.

03:13.610 --> 03:16.070
I suggest you start talking
before it's all gone.

03:16.154 --> 03:18.531
We still haven't done my other eye!

03:20.575 --> 03:23.786
I was hired by a company called Dondenkai.

03:24.370 --> 03:28.207
<i>It's a toxic workplace that makes us
work solo even on tough hits.</i>

03:28.291 --> 03:31.544
Then again, I guess everything
about the underworld is toxic.

03:31.628 --> 03:34.380
You called us losers for fearing death,

03:34.464 --> 03:36.132
and yet Lu's threat has you blabbing.

03:37.342 --> 03:39.552
It's not like I have a death wish.

03:39.636 --> 03:42.222
And I'm just a part-time employee,

03:42.305 --> 03:45.433
so I don't have any particular loyalty
toward the company.

03:45.516 --> 03:48.144
Are you registered with the JAA?

03:48.228 --> 03:49.771
Of course.

03:49.854 --> 03:51.189
What's the JAA?

03:51.272 --> 03:52.690
Oh. I think...

03:53.358 --> 03:54.359
I still have my license.

03:54.442 --> 03:55.276
VALID UNTIL KILLED

03:55.860 --> 03:58.488
Japanese Association of Assassins?

03:58.571 --> 03:59.405
"JAA" FOR SHORT

03:59.489 --> 04:01.115
They manage professional hit men.

04:01.199 --> 04:02.116
HIT MEN - JAA - CLIENT

04:02.200 --> 04:04.118
Mr. Sakamoto and I used to be members.

04:04.202 --> 04:05.161
REWARD - FEE - RETAINER

04:05.245 --> 04:07.747
There are only about 400 pros in Japan.

04:07.830 --> 04:10.667
Kinda looks like a driver's license.

04:10.750 --> 04:12.919
This is way harder to get, though.

04:13.002 --> 04:14.879
You're not photogenic at all.

04:14.963 --> 04:16.214
Give it back.

04:16.297 --> 04:19.467
You mind if I ask a question too?

04:20.218 --> 04:23.429
I heard you used to be in The Order.

04:23.513 --> 04:24.347
Is that true?

04:25.139 --> 04:26.391
"The Order"?

04:27.183 --> 04:28.685
My, my.

04:28.768 --> 04:31.271
So it's not just a myth.

04:32.146 --> 04:33.690
There you are!

04:33.773 --> 04:36.359
There they are, mommy!

04:36.442 --> 04:38.987
We were wondering where you guys went!

04:39.070 --> 04:41.155
Are we all ready to eat?

04:42.282 --> 04:45.451
Hey, you're the bad guy that got beat up!

04:45.535 --> 04:47.036
What are you guys doing?

04:48.788 --> 04:51.791
This guy from the superhero show was
practicing escape acts,

04:51.874 --> 04:53.167
so we came over to see!

04:53.251 --> 04:56.004
Wow. Keep up the good work!

04:56.087 --> 04:58.506
Hana helped make lunches!

04:58.589 --> 04:59.882
Lunch sounds good!

04:59.966 --> 05:01.801
There were some benches over there.

05:01.884 --> 05:04.178
Can't wait for the lunch you made, Hana!

05:04.262 --> 05:08.474
I made <i>onigiri</i> with cod roe,
and salmon, and tuna, and...

05:09.267 --> 05:11.352
We'll take care of these for you.

05:11.436 --> 05:13.896
Leave us alone now, got it?

05:13.980 --> 05:16.274
What? Aren't you gonna kill me?

05:16.357 --> 05:17.442
Of course not.

05:17.525 --> 05:21.946
We're here to enjoy the amusement park.

05:36.419 --> 05:37.712
That show you did,

05:37.795 --> 05:39.464
it was super cool!

05:39.547 --> 05:40.465
Bye-bye!

05:40.548 --> 05:42.175
Uh, okay.

05:44.510 --> 05:45.720
Did you tell him?

05:45.803 --> 05:49.682
Yeah! And I even gave him a band-aid.

05:49.766 --> 05:51.225
- Wow.
- How nice, Hana.

05:52.643 --> 05:54.687
Buncha freaks.

05:57.148 --> 05:59.567
I kinda ran out of steam.

06:00.276 --> 06:02.195
One more ride and then I'm outta here.

06:06.657 --> 06:08.034
What's wrong?

06:08.117 --> 06:12.038
I have brain fog...
Must be a side effect of the antidote.

06:12.121 --> 06:14.540
I don't think I can read minds today.

06:14.624 --> 06:17.168
But you're supposed to be our detector!

06:17.251 --> 06:19.420
This has never happened before.

06:19.504 --> 06:22.632
Mr. Manager, we should leave.
We're pushing our luck.

06:22.715 --> 06:25.760
I'm sorry to let you down, sir.

06:27.386 --> 06:28.930
Hey, everyone?

06:29.013 --> 06:31.390
What's wrong, Mommy?

06:31.474 --> 06:33.059
You're all acting weird today.

06:33.142 --> 06:35.269
Are you hiding something from me?

06:35.353 --> 06:36.729
What?

06:43.611 --> 06:45.488
If there's something on your mind,

06:45.571 --> 06:47.740
I'm here for you, Tatsu.

06:51.119 --> 06:54.163
Where do you think you're going, Tatsu?

06:54.247 --> 06:57.416
Could you get off me please?

06:57.500 --> 06:59.168
You're crushing me, lady.

07:00.378 --> 07:02.755
- Shut up, you little shi--
- Hey!

07:02.839 --> 07:04.340
What is it?

07:04.924 --> 07:07.135
You're a nice girl,

07:07.218 --> 07:09.846
don't spread your legs like that.

07:11.764 --> 07:14.100
I don't know where to look.

07:14.642 --> 07:15.726
<i>A nice girl?</i>

07:16.978 --> 07:20.189
What are you doing here, Boiled, Obiguro?

07:20.773 --> 07:23.401
Finishing your job, of course.

07:23.484 --> 07:26.446
It's like we have to chaperone you.

07:26.529 --> 07:30.783
If the job doesn't get done,
you'll get the axe in more ways than one.

07:30.867 --> 07:32.160
So, what do you say?

07:32.243 --> 07:33.828
Thanks a bunch.

07:34.579 --> 07:39.584
I can't wait to hit the legend,
Taro Sakamoto.

07:39.667 --> 07:43.129
Oh yeah, you've never met him.

07:44.589 --> 07:46.215
This scar remembers him clearly.

07:46.299 --> 07:49.760
Did Sakamoto give you that scar when--

07:49.844 --> 07:50.678
No!

07:50.761 --> 07:53.973
- I tripped and fell the other day.
- What? How bad did you fall...

07:54.056 --> 07:57.268
<i>These two are giving off
a silly vibe now, but...</i>

07:57.935 --> 08:00.438
<i>In the Balkan Battles two years ago,</i>

08:00.521 --> 08:03.649
<i>they killed over 100 people.</i>

08:03.733 --> 08:06.527
<i>They're the most brutal pair
the Dondenkai has seen.</i>

08:07.195 --> 08:09.405
<i>Sakamoto's crew is dead meat.</i>

08:09.489 --> 08:11.449
What are you talking about?

08:11.532 --> 08:13.659
We're not hiding anything!

08:13.743 --> 08:16.913
Did I not pack enough food?

08:16.996 --> 08:19.624
Or do you feel sick after all those rides?

08:19.707 --> 08:22.168
Daddy, do you guys not like theme parks?

08:22.251 --> 08:24.504
Nonsense! We're absolutely great!

08:24.587 --> 08:26.631
And we're having so much fun!

08:26.714 --> 08:29.884
He got so excited that he fell off
of the roller coaster.

08:31.010 --> 08:34.472
I guess it was all in my head.

08:34.555 --> 08:37.808
Can we choose the next ride too, then?

08:37.892 --> 08:40.937
Of course! Lead the way!

08:49.946 --> 08:50.863
What next?

08:50.947 --> 08:52.198
Ferris wheel!

09:04.961 --> 09:08.798
No assassins so far, Mr. Sakamoto.

09:08.881 --> 09:09.966
It'll be fine.

09:10.049 --> 09:12.301
The park is open and well lit.

09:12.385 --> 09:15.096
Not an assassin-friendly environment.

09:15.179 --> 09:16.931
Here we are.

09:17.014 --> 09:17.848
THE WARD OF WAILS

09:17.932 --> 09:19.934
Haunted house!

09:21.894 --> 09:25.106
<i>This place is super assassin-friendly!</i>

09:25.189 --> 09:26.023
GUIDE

09:26.107 --> 09:29.277
Welcome to the Ward of Wails.

09:29.360 --> 09:32.113
Having been chopped up by a mad doctor,

09:32.196 --> 09:36.117
the vengeful spirits of former patients
roam this hall of horror.

09:36.200 --> 09:37.994
Beware,

09:38.077 --> 09:41.539
for no soul has left the ward alive...

09:41.622 --> 09:44.292
Ooh, how thrilling.

09:44.375 --> 09:46.127
So spooky.

09:48.963 --> 09:49.839
What's that?

09:49.922 --> 09:51.924
A remedy for my nerves.

09:53.968 --> 09:55.886
Weirdo.

09:55.970 --> 09:57.847
OPERATING ROOM

09:57.930 --> 10:00.683
We hope you enjoy this terrifying tour.

10:08.274 --> 10:09.567
All right.

10:10.151 --> 10:12.695
Up for some authentic splatter horror?

10:26.167 --> 10:30.755
This is so well done! No wonder
it's Japan's scariest haunted house!

10:30.838 --> 10:33.132
I love what they did with the interior.

10:34.925 --> 10:38.262
You must be glad to see them having fun.

10:38.346 --> 10:39.221
Stay alert.

10:39.305 --> 10:41.307
Of course, sir.

10:43.017 --> 10:44.143
An enemy!

10:45.478 --> 10:46.479
Another zombie!

10:48.606 --> 10:49.607
Oh?

10:50.399 --> 10:52.485
The zombie stopped moving.

10:52.568 --> 10:55.571
Pretending to be afraid and attacking
from an angle out of his wife's view?

10:55.655 --> 10:57.323
Mr. Sakamoto, you're amazing.

10:59.408 --> 11:00.660
ESCAPE DOOR

11:00.743 --> 11:02.078
So scary, huh?

11:04.830 --> 11:06.582
His hit man license?

11:07.166 --> 11:09.794
He's a rookie that just registered.

11:09.877 --> 11:13.672
If these are the guys they've sent,
we've got nothing to worry about.

11:14.632 --> 11:16.342
<i>As long as that's all they've sent.</i>

11:19.678 --> 11:23.099
For such a fat-ass,
he does have some moves.

11:23.182 --> 11:27.061
Makes me wanna see what he can really do.

11:27.144 --> 11:28.479
HARD-BOILED GUIDE
WITH PHOTOS

11:28.562 --> 11:31.357
It gives me chills just imagining it.

11:31.440 --> 11:33.526
Don't lay a finger on him.

11:35.319 --> 11:38.114
He's mine to hit, hard-boiled style.

11:38.697 --> 11:41.075
Cut it out already.
I can't stand that sound.

11:41.158 --> 11:44.370
You should kick this habit of
working out when you're stressed.

11:45.204 --> 11:48.207
Don't worry, I'll let you have Sakamoto.

11:48.290 --> 11:49.875
He's your dear friend, right?

11:57.049 --> 11:58.509
We're not friends.

11:59.093 --> 12:02.638
That son of a bitch is no friend of mine.

12:02.721 --> 12:05.015
HIT MAN TRAINING CENTER
JCC (JAPAN CLEAR CREATION)

12:05.599 --> 12:06.434
Yo.

12:06.517 --> 12:07.351
BOILED (AGE 15)

12:07.435 --> 12:08.269
Sakamoto, is it?

12:08.811 --> 12:10.354
SAKAMOTO (AGE 14)

12:10.438 --> 12:14.608
I hear you're pretty damn good.

12:15.317 --> 12:18.446
You beat up one of my friends in practice.

12:18.529 --> 12:20.531
Made me wonder what kinda guy you were.

12:21.490 --> 12:25.035
Don't worry, I'm not here for revenge.

12:29.373 --> 12:31.459
You're a hard-boiled dude.

12:32.042 --> 12:33.544
I dig that.

12:34.628 --> 12:37.298
<i>He and I were two of a kind.</i>

12:37.381 --> 12:39.216
<i>Even outside of missions and classes,</i>

12:39.300 --> 12:42.470
<i>we naturally started spending
more and more time together.</i>

12:42.553 --> 12:43.929
JCC RICE BOWL

12:44.013 --> 12:45.639
You know, Sakamoto...

12:45.723 --> 12:46.557
THE HIT MAN POST

12:46.640 --> 12:49.101
...normal people celebrate
Valentine's Day today.

12:49.185 --> 12:52.480
Not us, though. We're hard-boiled.

12:52.563 --> 12:54.565
Our paths don't cross with chocolate and--

12:54.648 --> 12:56.108
There he is!

12:56.192 --> 12:58.986
- Go on.
- Um, Mr. Sakamoto,

12:59.069 --> 13:02.323
will you be my Valentine?

13:02.406 --> 13:04.783
I heard you liked .44 magnums,

13:04.867 --> 13:07.119
so I used an empty round
to mold the chocolates.

13:11.248 --> 13:13.292
Hey, Sakamoto.

13:13.959 --> 13:14.877
Nagumo.

13:14.960 --> 13:18.088
Check out the haul I got from the girls
in the Assassins department.

13:19.673 --> 13:21.091
Who's he?

13:21.175 --> 13:22.968
- No clue.
- What?!

13:25.179 --> 13:27.306
If you want more chocolate,
you can eat those.

13:28.349 --> 13:31.227
I had to turn down
the girls from the Poison department.

13:31.310 --> 13:33.020
Get out of the way!

13:41.028 --> 13:43.948
I thought we were alike,

13:44.573 --> 13:47.576
but he wasn't hard-boiled at all.

13:47.660 --> 13:49.870
<i>Wait, that's his beef with Sakamoto?</i>

13:49.954 --> 13:51.789
I see.

13:51.872 --> 13:55.918
Well, now you'll get to settle
an old score.

13:56.001 --> 13:56.835
It gives me chi--

13:56.919 --> 13:57.753
No!

13:58.712 --> 14:00.339
I don't even care anymore.

14:00.422 --> 14:03.259
<i>Is he acting tough? What a cutie.</i>

14:07.513 --> 14:10.224
How many of them are hiding in here?

14:10.307 --> 14:12.142
Human resources went all out.

14:14.019 --> 14:16.438
I want to go home.

14:16.522 --> 14:18.941
So many zombies! This is awesome!

14:19.024 --> 14:21.235
I wonder what the next one will be like.

14:21.777 --> 14:24.196
That girl's a real Sakamoto!

14:24.280 --> 14:26.407
She's got nerves of steel, unlike you.

14:27.283 --> 14:29.243
Shut up.

14:29.326 --> 14:30.452
I'll show you.

14:31.120 --> 14:33.497
Seriously, what's in that thing?

14:35.249 --> 14:37.710
The Lu clan's good luck remedy.

14:40.588 --> 14:43.424
Remedy, my ass! This is alcohol!

14:44.800 --> 14:47.928
OPERATION IN PROGRESS

14:56.395 --> 14:58.272
Knock it off, you guys!

15:00.232 --> 15:02.651
She didn't even hesitate!

15:06.363 --> 15:07.489
<i>I can't get through!</i>

15:23.547 --> 15:25.174
JAA LICENSE
VALID UNTIL KILLED

15:31.931 --> 15:33.057
Out of my way.

15:33.891 --> 15:35.392
Yo, Sakamoto.

15:36.393 --> 15:38.062
Remember me?

15:38.145 --> 15:39.521
I don't.

15:39.605 --> 15:41.065
Where's my family?

15:44.151 --> 15:45.903
I'm gonna show you hell.

15:47.696 --> 15:50.532
I'm gonna make you remember me.

15:51.116 --> 15:53.327
Not that I care or anything.

15:54.703 --> 15:55.579
Ms. Aoi!

15:55.663 --> 15:56.830
Hana!

16:01.835 --> 16:03.128
Thank goodness.

16:03.212 --> 16:04.713
They're just unconscious.

16:04.797 --> 16:08.717
I guess I got the short end of the stick.

16:08.801 --> 16:12.429
You little shits won't be any fun.

16:12.513 --> 16:13.639
Who are you--

16:17.810 --> 16:19.353
Bring it on, you old hag.

16:19.436 --> 16:23.273
Lemme show you what my family's
passed down for 4,000 years.

16:23.357 --> 16:25.734
Is it Tai Chi? No, Drunken Fist?

16:25.818 --> 16:26.860
You reek of alcohol!

16:27.653 --> 16:28.487
Oh, my.

16:28.570 --> 16:31.198
This one's feisty, isn't she?

16:31.782 --> 16:33.742
It gives me chills.

16:36.161 --> 16:40.082
You really don't remember me, Sakamoto?

16:40.165 --> 16:41.625
I told you I don't.

16:41.709 --> 16:43.127
Drop it already.

16:43.210 --> 16:44.795
Where's my family?

16:45.504 --> 16:47.256
I'll tell you this.

16:47.339 --> 16:49.842
I don't remember you that much either.

16:49.925 --> 16:51.760
Why would I?

16:51.844 --> 16:53.595
Answer the question.

16:53.679 --> 16:56.807
Go look for 'em yourself.

16:56.890 --> 16:59.351
I'm not your mama.

17:18.495 --> 17:19.329
Boom.

17:22.416 --> 17:23.542
This is sad to see,

17:25.002 --> 17:26.170
Sakamoto.

17:32.342 --> 17:34.094
Party's getting started.

17:35.554 --> 17:37.890
What're you looking at, hag?

17:40.350 --> 17:42.269
You're not bad.

17:43.312 --> 17:46.982
That was a good punch. No wasted tension.

17:47.066 --> 17:48.609
Oops?

17:48.692 --> 17:49.860
But...

17:49.943 --> 17:51.653
Not good enough to beat me.

17:53.864 --> 17:54.948
I feel sick...

17:55.491 --> 17:56.325
Lu!

17:57.326 --> 17:58.202
The thing is,

17:58.702 --> 18:00.954
if I actually cared,

18:01.038 --> 18:03.916
you'd both be dead in a second.

18:04.625 --> 18:07.669
But that doesn't give me chills, you see?

18:07.753 --> 18:09.463
So...

18:12.299 --> 18:14.885
Let go of me! Hey!

18:14.968 --> 18:17.930
I wanna see what you can really do.

18:20.307 --> 18:22.309
In my experience,

18:22.392 --> 18:25.896
your real strength shows
when you're panicking the most.

18:30.400 --> 18:32.528
The rules are simple.

18:32.611 --> 18:36.073
You have to hit me once every 10 seconds.

18:36.657 --> 18:38.367
If you fail,

18:38.450 --> 18:40.577
your boy goes home in pieces.

18:42.204 --> 18:44.331
You're running out of time.

18:44.414 --> 18:46.083
Is this giving you chills?

18:48.252 --> 18:50.629
There's no way I can do that!

18:50.712 --> 18:52.131
I'm sorry, Shin.

18:52.214 --> 18:54.967
<i>She's an emotional drunk?</i>

19:03.892 --> 19:06.770
It's been five years since you retired.

19:07.312 --> 19:08.772
Get it, Sakamoto?

19:09.481 --> 19:11.733
This is the difference of five years.

19:12.359 --> 19:14.319
The difference between you and me.

19:15.654 --> 19:16.989
It's sad to see.

19:17.072 --> 19:20.701
You used to be such a hard-boiled guy.

19:23.453 --> 19:25.455
There's nothing you can do.

19:25.539 --> 19:28.667
With my Super Ball Bombs,

19:28.750 --> 19:30.002
also known as...

19:30.085 --> 19:31.461
SBB.

19:32.087 --> 19:34.256
And my Rocket Dynamite Punch,

19:34.339 --> 19:35.549
also known as...

19:35.632 --> 19:37.301
RDP.

19:37.885 --> 19:41.138
I can get you at any distance, any angle.

19:41.263 --> 19:43.599
Did you forget that, too?

19:44.224 --> 19:45.142
<i>So cringey.</i>

19:45.726 --> 19:48.896
<i>Look at this, Sakamoto! Nagumo!</i>

19:49.897 --> 19:52.191
I put dynamite in here

19:52.691 --> 19:55.235
and use the momentum from the blast.

19:55.319 --> 19:56.320
Neat, right?

19:56.403 --> 19:58.197
Sure, interesting.

19:58.655 --> 19:59.698
Does it have a name?

19:59.781 --> 20:01.825
Rocket Dynamite Punch!

20:01.909 --> 20:04.328
RDP for short.

20:05.412 --> 20:06.413
<i>So cringey.</i>

20:06.496 --> 20:08.373
You should call it Super Punch.

20:08.457 --> 20:09.333
Super?

20:09.416 --> 20:12.002
That gives me an idea. Super Ball!

20:12.085 --> 20:14.171
<i>- All his ideas are cringey.</i>
- I dunno about that.

20:14.254 --> 20:16.089
- Super Ball is great!
- Go with Super Punch.

20:16.173 --> 20:18.217
COMPOSITION
POTASSIUM PERCHLORATE 10G

20:18.300 --> 20:20.219
I looked up to you!

20:22.512 --> 20:24.223
You completed any mission

20:24.306 --> 20:25.891
and got chocolates from girls.

20:25.974 --> 20:30.646
But now, you've become so weak!

20:31.230 --> 20:33.565
That really pisses me off!

20:36.068 --> 20:37.486
Look at you now.

20:38.278 --> 20:40.322
You can't protect your family.

20:40.405 --> 20:41.615
You're nothing

20:41.698 --> 20:43.408
but a fat-ass!

21:06.431 --> 21:08.267
Sweet dreams, Sakamoto.

21:17.317 --> 21:19.611
<i>Farewell, my sweet teenage memories.</i>

21:24.908 --> 21:26.994
<i>What was that threat I just felt?</i>

21:27.995 --> 21:30.580
10g of potassium perchlorate.

21:31.748 --> 21:34.459
4.8g of ammonium nitrate.

21:35.168 --> 21:37.504
20g of P-thrite.

21:37.587 --> 21:40.215
3.5g of Nitro GK.

21:40.299 --> 21:43.343
<i>Is that the composition of my bombs?</i>

21:43.927 --> 21:46.054
I remember you now, Boiled.

21:52.269 --> 21:54.980
Time to show you what I can really do.

23:20.941 --> 23:25.946

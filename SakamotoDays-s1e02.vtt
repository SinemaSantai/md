WEBVTT

00:06.256 --> 00:07.632
Thank you, come again!

01:43.019 --> 01:43.812
SAKAMOTO'S

01:43.895 --> 01:46.523
Man, Mister Sakamoto,
I can't get over how badass

01:46.606 --> 01:49.776
you were the other day!
I've never witnessed close-quarters

01:49.859 --> 01:51.736
combat as flawless as that before!

01:51.820 --> 01:55.657
Even this far into retirement,
there's nobody who can match you.

01:55.740 --> 01:57.992
You showed up, and you were like pow!

01:58.076 --> 02:00.370
- Get back to work.
- And you iced pretty

02:00.453 --> 02:02.580
- much all of em in one hit!
- What? "Iced"?

02:04.999 --> 02:08.044
Beloved...
I know you're not about to tell me

02:08.128 --> 02:10.755
you've gone back to killing, right?!

02:11.756 --> 02:14.884
But... you killed like all
those dudes, didn't you?

02:14.968 --> 02:17.178
None of their wounds were lethal.

02:17.262 --> 02:19.597
Because,
sweetie... and I know you know this...

02:20.098 --> 02:23.268
break the family rules
and I'll divorce you!

02:23.768 --> 02:25.019
Dee vorce!

02:30.108 --> 02:35.446
I'm glad we understand each other.
Now then, I'm gonna go sweep the sidewalk.

02:37.532 --> 02:40.118
So uh... what are these family rules?

02:43.830 --> 02:47.333
Why are you always
daydreaming about ways to take me out?!

02:47.417 --> 02:48.668
You talk too much.

02:49.586 --> 02:50.920
NIIKITA CHINATOWN

02:52.380 --> 02:54.674
Wow, Niikita Chinatown is so big!

02:56.092 --> 02:57.677
This place is great.

02:58.469 --> 03:03.057
But... there must be some place closer
to home we could've stocked up, right?

03:05.268 --> 03:06.311
Thank you!

03:08.313 --> 03:12.275
- Can't buy more than fifty per day.
- Meat Buns? That's what we

03:12.358 --> 03:13.735
came all the way here for?

03:14.485 --> 03:16.196
To share with Aoi and Hana.

03:21.159 --> 03:24.245
Oh man... he loves his family so much...

03:24.996 --> 03:29.459
Say... what were those family rules
Missus Sakamoto was talking about?

03:29.542 --> 03:34.214
Shut up. All you have to do is
think about it! Then I can stop asking!

03:35.089 --> 03:36.883
Hey, get out of the way!

03:40.428 --> 03:41.346
Mister Sakamoto!

03:47.268 --> 03:49.354
The meat buns are crushed...

03:49.979 --> 03:53.233
Maybe we could just dust
them off a little bit.

03:53.316 --> 03:54.692
Nope, no we can't.

03:55.276 --> 03:57.612
- Ah! There she is!
- You're in for it now!

03:57.695 --> 03:58.363
Come back here!

04:00.365 --> 04:02.617
MYSTERY WOMAN
LU SHAOTANG

04:02.700 --> 04:06.537
You're not getting away. So quit
running, you scared little cat.

04:06.621 --> 04:10.041
You're not good enough
to get your hands on me.

04:10.124 --> 04:13.503
Oh boy. ' Mister Sakamoto?
This looks like it could be trouble.

04:13.586 --> 04:14.837
The meat buns...

04:19.384 --> 04:23.012
Wait, ' this isn't the time
to be worried about that!

04:29.310 --> 04:31.354
Whoa. Is that tai chi?

04:31.938 --> 04:33.231
We gotta surround her!

04:42.657 --> 04:43.241
Come here!

04:49.831 --> 04:51.457
Ha! I've got you now.

04:52.041 --> 04:53.126
Let go of me!

04:55.253 --> 04:59.048
We can't kill her but we can hurt her.

05:00.258 --> 05:03.970
I'll start with her legs
so she can't run anymore.

05:10.727 --> 05:12.937
How'd he do that?!

05:17.317 --> 05:19.110
Don't move! You piece o' shit!

05:19.944 --> 05:22.822
- Watch out!
- You're gonna die, you--

05:37.587 --> 05:39.881
What the hell... She's good...

05:40.465 --> 05:42.550
Look! She's over there!

05:42.633 --> 05:44.719
And she's got her gang
with her! After them!

05:44.802 --> 05:45.970
We're not a gang.

05:46.721 --> 05:48.973
- But we should run anyway!
- Slow em down!

05:49.057 --> 05:49.932
You're gonna die!

05:51.809 --> 05:54.395
- Who the hell are you guys?
- Dammit.

06:00.443 --> 06:02.236
What happened to the girl?

06:02.320 --> 06:04.197
I'm afraid she gave us the slip...

06:04.697 --> 06:07.825
She's on the run with a pair
of men we didn't recognize.

06:07.909 --> 06:10.995
We'll figure out who they
are. Then we can track them.

06:11.079 --> 06:12.580
So you lost her again?!

06:13.331 --> 06:14.332
DANSHOKAI
CHAIRMAN

06:14.916 --> 06:18.836
We already killed her entire family,
we had her cornered!

06:18.920 --> 06:22.215
What was the point of that ' if she
gets away from us?! You're worthless!

06:22.298 --> 06:24.175
I'm sorry, sir!

06:26.010 --> 06:28.971
Oh, yeah? Well I'm done with you!

06:30.431 --> 06:31.641
Get out of my sight.

06:31.724 --> 06:32.725
Sir--

06:36.896 --> 06:37.730
Hm?

06:40.691 --> 06:45.321
Check it out, Son Hee. He's still
trying to breathe like he doesn't know

06:45.822 --> 06:46.823
he's already dead.

06:46.906 --> 06:52.245
Little brother... Stop playing around
with corpses. It's undignified, Bacho.

06:54.288 --> 06:56.124
These two are insane.

06:56.707 --> 06:59.419
Listen up. That girl has a key and I

06:59.502 --> 07:03.172
need you to bring it to me.
Once I get my hands on it,

07:03.256 --> 07:07.635
I'll have control of the black market.
You must catch that girl,

07:07.718 --> 07:09.595
whatever it takes!

07:09.679 --> 07:12.098
We can do that,
if we can kill anyone in our way.

07:12.682 --> 07:14.434
Whatever it takes.

07:18.020 --> 07:20.231
What?! You're from a mafia family?!

07:20.731 --> 07:23.109
The Lu family?! They're famous!

07:23.609 --> 07:25.820
Can you please keep it down?

07:25.903 --> 07:27.530
Why are they chasing you?

07:29.240 --> 07:31.868
- To get their hands on this.
- What's that?

07:31.951 --> 07:34.704
It's a key to my family's secret safe.

07:34.787 --> 07:39.250
- My parents entrusted it to me.
- Well, it's not worth dying over, is it?

07:39.333 --> 07:41.085
I'd get rid of that thing.

07:41.169 --> 07:43.379
I'd never do that!

07:44.547 --> 07:46.424
My Mama and Papa...

07:46.924 --> 07:49.760
They gave their lives to protect it...

07:54.056 --> 07:55.391
Shaotang! Run, now!

07:57.226 --> 07:59.061
Hurry! There's no time!

08:06.736 --> 08:09.697
What kind of daughter would
throw it away now?

08:09.780 --> 08:14.619
How could I look them in the eye when
I meet them in the afterlife? Anyway...

08:14.702 --> 08:17.288
my sob story is none of your concern.

08:17.371 --> 08:19.916
Sorry I got you involved in this.

08:22.543 --> 08:27.131
- Here's where we say goodbye.
- Do you uh... You don't know

08:27.215 --> 08:28.674
how to make meat buns, do you?

08:28.758 --> 08:30.218
What? Meat buns?

08:31.802 --> 08:36.432
Yeah, I think Papa had a recipe. So I
should know the basic flavors anyway, why?

08:36.516 --> 08:40.228
Mister Sakamoto, are you sure
this is what you want to do?

08:40.311 --> 08:44.774
- Hanging with her could be dangerous.
- Restocking the store can wait.

08:45.525 --> 08:46.984
We're helping the girl.

08:48.569 --> 08:51.364
When it's over,
you can thank us by making

08:51.447 --> 08:53.658
your dad's meat buns.
Those are our conditions.

08:53.741 --> 08:56.118
Huh? Who are you people?

08:57.620 --> 08:59.455
Mister Sakamoto!

09:08.548 --> 09:09.715
Mister Sakamoto!!

09:10.299 --> 09:13.719
We wasted too much time talking
to each other. These two...

09:14.428 --> 09:16.722
Great. Now we're in real trouble.

09:17.765 --> 09:20.977
Bacho,
have I ever told you you have no style?

09:22.311 --> 09:24.772
Gimme a break. Why should an assassin

09:24.855 --> 09:26.607
be worried about style?

09:27.191 --> 09:30.695
Kill the target on sight.
You can always arrange the

09:30.778 --> 09:33.239
corpses nicely afterward.

09:33.322 --> 09:35.825
But the problem is how
you kill your targets.

09:35.908 --> 09:38.786
I swear, it's like talking to a monkey.

09:38.869 --> 09:41.747
- I take it you know these guys?
- Son Hee and Bacho.

09:42.540 --> 09:43.791
The Twin Assassins.

09:45.126 --> 09:49.255
For a fee, they'll kill anyone.
And they don't ask questions.

09:49.338 --> 09:52.967
They're serial killers,
who take pleasure in taking lives.

09:53.551 --> 09:57.805
Disgusting creeps who bring the heads
of their victims home to sketch them.

09:58.389 --> 10:02.226
Wow, I didn't know we were
famous. Isn't that great, Son Hee?

10:02.310 --> 10:07.023
No, you fool. Hit men should live in
the shadows, you should be ashamed if you

10:07.106 --> 10:10.276
- stand out.
- Couldn't have said it better myself!

10:12.236 --> 10:16.032
Did we upset you by killing your friend?
Well aren't you a sensitive little flower?

10:16.115 --> 10:20.036
What the hell are you talking about?

10:20.119 --> 10:22.788
You think that was enough to kill him?

10:24.123 --> 10:28.210
If you don't know Mister
Sakamoto, then you're an amateur at best.

10:28.294 --> 10:30.379
Yap all you like, little dog.

10:52.026 --> 10:52.777
Son of a...

10:53.653 --> 10:55.279
Who do you think you are?

11:00.826 --> 11:03.079
A red bean bun would be nice, too.

11:14.840 --> 11:16.008
Where are we?

11:19.220 --> 11:22.306
Impressive.
He must be a rather powerful man.

11:23.224 --> 11:23.891
Don't you think?

11:25.267 --> 11:28.270
The roof was rotting, so what?

11:28.896 --> 11:31.482
Just another asshole we get to kill.

11:31.565 --> 11:32.191
Woman.

11:33.275 --> 11:37.196
Hand the key over to us now, and your
death will be a beautiful one. Sound fair?

11:37.279 --> 11:41.200
My parents trusted me with this key.

11:41.283 --> 11:44.954
- I'll gladly give my life to keep it safe!
- Ridiculous.

11:45.746 --> 11:50.376
But your parents said the same thing
right before we killed them.

11:50.459 --> 11:55.423
You fools. Caring more about your
trinkets than your own lives. That only

11:55.506 --> 11:58.384
- proves how worthless you are.
- Shut your mouth!

11:59.218 --> 12:00.052
No!

12:04.724 --> 12:07.852
- What are you doing?!
- Moron. You can't let them

12:07.935 --> 12:09.812
get under your skin so easy.

12:11.188 --> 12:15.109
They can't get in that safe.
Everything my family's ever

12:15.192 --> 12:19.280
cared about is in there.
Mama and Papa were protecting it...

12:19.363 --> 12:21.490
- when these monsters...
- Let me help.

12:25.202 --> 12:27.204
Now what would you do that for?

12:28.205 --> 12:31.876
Sounds to me like she wants
to be with her parents again.

12:31.959 --> 12:37.006
You can't choose what's important to
others. That's their decision to make.

12:38.591 --> 12:42.219
I don't get it.
Why are you trying so hard to protect

12:42.303 --> 12:44.346
somebody you don't even know?

12:54.899 --> 12:56.776
You're covered in blood again.

12:57.276 --> 12:58.944
I just got back from work.

12:59.528 --> 13:02.615
You mean you just got back
from killing people, huh?!

13:02.698 --> 13:05.117
How can you bear to do something so awful?

13:05.618 --> 13:08.996
I couldn't afford to buy you
a present if I didn't work.

13:09.079 --> 13:13.709
Well, I don't want a present that's
been stained with blood money like that.

13:14.835 --> 13:16.045
- I've had enough.
- What?

13:18.088 --> 13:21.217
If I can't convince you to change, then I...

13:23.177 --> 13:24.887
Then I can't be with you.

13:25.554 --> 13:26.430
Goodbye.

13:35.856 --> 13:38.275
- What's going on?
- Someone just fell!

13:44.031 --> 13:48.619
That was higher than I thought it was.
I'm glad there's snow on the ground.

13:50.329 --> 13:51.205
Don't you see?

13:51.705 --> 13:55.292
When I was falling,
you were thinking about how sad

13:55.376 --> 13:58.754
you'd be if I died weren't you?
Do you get it?

13:58.838 --> 14:02.258
You wanted to save me because
of how much I matter to you.

14:02.341 --> 14:06.470
Everyone has someone that cherishes
them the way you cherish me.

14:06.971 --> 14:09.807
Right now, I need you to make a promise.

14:13.602 --> 14:17.940
Promise me you won't kill anyone.
This is our number one rule.

14:18.691 --> 14:22.486
And to make up for the lives you've
already taken... ...from now on,

14:22.570 --> 14:25.531
you'll devote yourself to
helping people instead.

14:31.912 --> 14:33.205
Bleeding stopped.

14:33.914 --> 14:35.374
No killing, Shin, right?

14:35.875 --> 14:38.627
Right! Mister Sakamoto!

14:39.211 --> 14:41.839
Quit acting like you're so cool, amateur!

15:05.779 --> 15:06.614
Hm?

15:14.914 --> 15:17.708
Turns out you're not half-bad.

15:21.170 --> 15:22.546
Bacho, time to use it.

15:23.297 --> 15:25.966
All right, big brother. ' Let's do it.

15:31.263 --> 15:32.890
Iron Pot Special
Technique! Tofu Scramble!

15:32.973 --> 15:35.059
Iron Pot Special
Technique! Tofu Scramble!

15:37.436 --> 15:39.063
Prepare to be shredded!

15:43.567 --> 15:44.401
Huh?

15:45.778 --> 15:47.738
Mister Sakamoto? Are you okay?

15:47.821 --> 15:49.615
Pulled a neck muscle.

15:50.115 --> 15:51.659
Here, this should help.

15:51.742 --> 15:56.622
What? How did he dodge us?
No one's ever escaped our Tofu Scramble.

15:58.207 --> 16:01.669
And he's huge!
How can he be completely unscathed?

16:03.420 --> 16:05.297
Bacho, time for the other one.

16:05.798 --> 16:08.801
All right, Big Brother. This will get him!

16:10.010 --> 16:12.721
You're only the third person
to witness this one!

16:14.098 --> 16:15.724
Iron Pot Special Technique!

16:18.143 --> 16:18.894
Wha...

16:21.271 --> 16:22.648
You bastard!

16:27.736 --> 16:33.701
My chakram's supposed to be unbreakable...
and he shattered it! It's impossible!

16:37.287 --> 16:41.166
Been a while since I held
something that heavy. Kinda hurt.

16:41.250 --> 16:43.085
Your hand! Let me bandage it.

16:43.669 --> 16:47.423
Dammit.
I'm not going to worry about them anymore.

16:47.506 --> 16:48.882
I'll just kill the woman!

16:49.383 --> 16:51.010
I can hear everything!

16:59.435 --> 17:01.061
COOL IMPACT!!

17:10.904 --> 17:14.700
Okay, I'm gonna ask again:
who the hell are you guys?

17:19.038 --> 17:20.205
Just shopkeepers.

17:21.457 --> 17:25.335
I don't get it, but I
guess I don't have to, huh?

17:25.419 --> 17:29.465
Come on! What the hell are
Bacho and Son Hee doing?!

17:29.548 --> 17:32.968
The treasure is right behind
these doors and yet...

17:33.052 --> 17:35.429
I can't get in until those two
maniacs bring me the key!

17:35.512 --> 17:37.598
Special delivery!

17:40.642 --> 17:41.977
Bacho! Son Hee!

17:43.353 --> 17:47.107
Wh... Who the hell are you two?
What's my security doing letting you--

17:47.191 --> 17:48.192
Shut up.

17:48.275 --> 17:51.987
- Don't say another word.
- I... who's that?

17:52.488 --> 17:55.074
I'm so sorry! I shouldn't have done it!

17:55.657 --> 17:57.242
I'll do anything you ask!
Anything! Please,

17:57.326 --> 17:58.911
I want my Mama and Papa back but
you can't do that, can you?

17:58.994 --> 17:59.912
Forgive--

18:02.122 --> 18:03.707
Ask for forgiveness in hell.

18:12.883 --> 18:15.260
That's all you're doing?
' You sure that's enough?

18:15.344 --> 18:17.471
How 'bout a little more just in case?

18:19.640 --> 18:22.726
Why do you have to think
about killing me all the time?!

18:22.810 --> 18:24.144
Don't get carried away.

18:26.855 --> 18:27.731
This is plenty.

18:28.232 --> 18:29.066
Hm?

18:30.234 --> 18:34.196
If I killed every person who'd
done me wrong it'd never stop.

18:34.279 --> 18:38.492
Papa always said to live a happy life.
That's the best revenge.

18:43.455 --> 18:45.874
Hey lady, how long's
it take to open a door?

18:45.958 --> 18:48.460
Don't be so rude! '
And don't call me lady.

18:48.544 --> 18:50.629
I have a name. It's Lu Shaotang.

18:51.713 --> 18:55.175
This lock is tricky because
it's such an old key...

18:56.760 --> 18:59.555
- Hey look at that, you got it.
- What's inside?

18:59.638 --> 19:02.182
Why are you going in before I do?!

19:03.892 --> 19:06.436
Treasure! Gold and silver and...

19:07.896 --> 19:08.605
Huh?

19:09.106 --> 19:11.233
Books... CDs... and stuffed animals?

19:11.942 --> 19:14.236
There's all kinds of stuff here.

19:14.820 --> 19:16.405
An inventory?

19:18.407 --> 19:21.994
What do we have here...
? "Every generation's family head,

19:22.077 --> 19:25.497
must offer their greatest
treasure to the Lu family

19:25.581 --> 19:26.456
vault."

19:27.666 --> 19:29.877
Okay, so everything in here
came from a different family head.

19:29.960 --> 19:31.837
I wonder what Papa left behind.

19:38.719 --> 19:42.264
- Care to share with the class?
- "Sake to drink with

19:42.347 --> 19:44.808
Shaotang when she comes of age."

19:46.643 --> 19:48.395
He always put me first...

19:49.396 --> 19:51.148
Hellooo? What does it say?

19:52.232 --> 19:57.946
It says that this is the most delicious
bottle of sake in the world. Have some!

19:58.030 --> 19:59.865
As thanks for your help.

20:00.949 --> 20:03.911
Okay, but it better be as good as you say.

20:06.496 --> 20:09.458
I can't believe you held
onto those, Mister Sakamoto.

20:09.541 --> 20:11.668
What are they? They all got smashed.

20:12.169 --> 20:14.630
Yeah, because you jumped on them.

20:14.713 --> 20:16.506
Didn't hurt the taste.

20:20.010 --> 20:24.348
Wow! Japanese meat buns aren't too bad,
are they?

21:56.815 --> 22:00.944
Shots fired in Niikita Chinatown yesterday
in what is believed to be a

22:01.028 --> 22:03.196
dispute between members of the mafia.
Witnesses report--

22:03.280 --> 22:05.365
Hey, good morning!

22:05.866 --> 22:09.077
Keep it down. Head hurts. Hangover...

22:11.246 --> 22:13.373
Here you go! Something to drink.

22:14.458 --> 22:15.334
Hello--

22:16.460 --> 22:20.047
- Boss Man, the apron's a perfect fit.
- Wait, what the hell are you doing here?!

22:20.547 --> 22:24.801
Where else am I gonna work?
He hired me to make meat buns.

22:24.885 --> 22:28.263
You have a mountain of
treasure, why do you need to work?

22:28.347 --> 22:31.558
I can't just sell off my family
heirlooms like that. You dumbass.

22:31.641 --> 22:34.686
- What'd you call me?!
- Would you prefer "dipshit"?

22:34.770 --> 22:37.105
Keep it down. I'm begging you...

22:37.189 --> 22:40.650
Oh, ' I almost forgot!
Hey, ' Mister Sakamoto?

22:41.485 --> 22:44.571
I heard your story,
about why you quit killing.

22:44.654 --> 22:45.655
Who told you?

22:46.573 --> 22:51.953
You were thinking about it during the
fight yesterday. I just wanted to tell you

22:52.037 --> 22:55.499
- that it really moved me.
- You're part of the family now, so

22:55.582 --> 22:59.086
- you need to follow the rules, too.
- Okay!

23:03.340 --> 23:05.759
"Rule number one: Never kill anyone."

23:06.259 --> 23:10.597
- I'll kill you if you break them.
- You can't, that's against the rules!

23:15.602 --> 23:17.145
This came from the JAA.

23:18.647 --> 23:23.068
They've put a substantial bounty
on the big guy. A billion yen.
